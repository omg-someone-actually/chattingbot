Go to the top right and create a new project, make it a "python" project.<br/>
Copy paste the code.<br/>
Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and make a new application, name it whatever you want your bot to be named.<br/>
Scroll down and find "add a bot", add it. Then name the bot whatever and give it a profile picture.<br/>
CLick "copy token" and go back to repl.it, then scroll down and find "client.run()", replace what I said with your token.<br/>
