# chattingbot
A simple chatting bot, no AI, mainly for a few servers.

For setup, go to https://repl.it (*I am reccomedning this so everyone can use it and its the simplest*) <hr>
Go to the top right and create a new project, make it a "python" project.
Copy paste the code.
Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and make a new application, name it whatever you want your bot to be named.
Scroll down and find "add a bot", add it. Then name the bot whatever and give it a profile picture.
CLick "copy token" and go back to repl.it, then scroll down and find "client.run()", replace what I said with your token.
